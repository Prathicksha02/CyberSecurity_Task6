# Task-6

## Objective
The objective of this task is to understand the factors that contribute to a strong password by creating passwords with varying levels of complexity, testing them using an online password strength tool, and learning how complexity affects password security. This task also provides insight into common password attack methods.

## Passwords Created and Evaluated

| **Password**         | **Estimated Crack Time** |                 **Observations**                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `hello`              | Instantly                | Very weak, lacks complexity and length           |
| `hello12`            | 1 second                 | Weak, predictable, lacks symbols/uppercase       |
| `sparrow`            | Instantly                | Common word, no numbers or symbols               |
| `Sparrow222_!@`      | 15 billion years         | Strong, good mix of uppercase, numbers, symbols  |
| `P@55w0rD_!7hK9#`    | 15 billion years         | Extremely strong, complex and long password      |
| `Cyber_@Security123` | 7 quadrillion years      | Very strong, good use of words, symbols, numbers |

## Creating Strong Passwords
1. Use passwords with at least 12-16 characters
2. Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
3. Avoid simple patterns or common dictionary words alone
4. Use meaningful but unpredictable passphrases for better memorability
5. Strong passwords resist brute force and dictionary attacks

## Common Password Attacks

| **Attack Type**         | **Description**                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Brute Force Attack**  | Systematically tries every possible character combination. Longer, complex passwords take significantly longer to crack.            |
| **Dictionary Attack**   | Uses lists of common words or known weak passwords to guess credentials. Avoiding dictionary words helps prevent this.              |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Attackers use leaked passwords from one platform to try accessing other accounts, highlighting the danger of password reuse.        |
| **Phishing Attacks**    | Tricks users into revealing passwords fake websites or emails. Even strong passwords are ineffective if voluntarily given away. |

## How Password Complexity Affects Security
Password complexity dramatically increases the time required to crack a password:

Simple passwords (e.g., hello, hello12) can be cracked instantly or in seconds using automated tools.

Longer, mixed-character passwords (e.g., Sparrow222_!@, Cyber_@Security123) can resist attacks for billions to quadrillions of years.

**Complexity Benefits:**
1. More characters exponentially increase the difficulty
2. Mixing letters, numbers, and symbols breaks predictable patterns
3. Avoiding dictionary words reduces vulnerability to common attacks

Conclusion: Complex, long, and unpredictable passwords are essential to defend against modern cyberattacks such as brute force, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing.

## Conclusion
This evaluation demonstrates that password strength dramatically improves with length, character diversity, and unpredictability. Weak passwords can be cracked in seconds, while complex ones resist attacks for billions of years, making them essential for protecting sensitive data.
